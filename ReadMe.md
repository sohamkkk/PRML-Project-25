# üì∞ News Authentication & Domain Classifier
A machine learning-powered tool designed to verify the authenticity of news articles and classify them into appropriate domains (e.g., Politics, COVID-19, Government Affairs, etc.).


## üìå Project Objective

To develop a robust system that:

- Authenticates news: Identifies whether a news article is true or false.

- Classifies domain: Assigns the news to a relevant topic category.

- Leverages web search and semantic understanding for human-like validation.
## üß† Key Features

- Checks if a news article is **real or fake** using smart machine learning models  
- Identifies the **topic** of the news (like Politics, COVID-19, Government, etc.)  
- Uses **Google Search (via [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/))** to find similar articles for better accuracy  
- Applies **BERT**, a powerful language model, to understand the meaning of news  
- Compares different machine learning models like SVM, Decision Tree, ANN, etc.  
- Uses a **combination of the best models** (SVM + Decision Tree + ANN) to improve topic detection  
- Designed to work in a way that **mimics human judgment** by checking real-time news articles online
